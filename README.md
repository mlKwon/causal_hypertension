# "check the causal relationship between hypertension and binge drinking by using G-formula (R)"

I use the Korea Health Panel (KHP) data from 2008 to 2017 for analyzing the causal relationship between hypertension and binge drinking.

Because KHP data provides us yearly longitudinal data, we will subset the appropriate subject, and check the causal relationship by using g-formula

# G-formula
G-formula is a statistical method to estimate the causal effects of sustained treatment strategies from observational data with time-varying treatments, confounders, and outcomes.

Thus, it will be the most proper statistical method to our panel data.


# Note
This is the example code of using g-formula by R. If you want to use this method by R, it will be helpful to see this code.
